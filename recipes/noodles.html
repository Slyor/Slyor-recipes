  <img src="noodles.webp" alt="Noodles">
  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <p>Combine egg, milk, and salt in a bowl. Add sifted flour and stir until a dough forms, adding more flour as needed, a little at a time, for the dough to come together. Separate into two balls.</p>
      <p>Sprinkle a work surface with flour and roll out each piece of dough as thin as you like. Let rolled dough rest for 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>Cut into strips and spread to dry, dusting with a bit of flour so the noodles don't stick together. Let dry for approximately 2 hours.</p>
      <p>Cook noodles in boiling salted water, or hot soup, until tender, about 10 minutes.</p>
